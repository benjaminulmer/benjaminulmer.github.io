I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Faramarz Samavati](https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~samavati/) in the [GIV](https://giv.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/) research group.
My research focused on the geometric aspects of creating better data structures for 3D geospatial data.
I also received a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Calgary with a specialization in computer graphics.

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a gymnastics coach at the Calgary Gymnastics Centre.
I was also a gymnast myself until the age of fifteen.

In my free time, you can find me theory-crafting D&D characters, playing the latest indie video games, baking more desserts than I know what to do with, and wishing I had more excuses to ride my motorcycle.
Je suis en train d'étudier le français aussi.

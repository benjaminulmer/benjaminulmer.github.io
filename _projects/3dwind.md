## Overview
Brief overview of project.
Link to source code.
Motivation, history, language, libraries, etc. etc.

### Video Demo
<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='NdJQopRuH1E' -%}</div>

## Data Source
ERA5 and link.
Some additional information about resolution and such.

## Streamlines
What is streamline.

### Integration
Integration method.
Coordinate conversion.
Adaptive step and error bounds.

### Seeding
Seeding algorithm and paper.
Custom distance metric for altitude.
Voxel grid for acceleration.
Multiresolution extension.

## Rendering
Need to make streamlines look good.
Colours, shading, animation, etc.

## Diffuse and Specular
All figures thus far have.
Link paper.

### Altitude
Scale, colour, and both.

### Streamline Transparency
Formula.
Animation based on time.

## Limitations
Colour not done in shader.
Multiresolution seeding takes a long time---not live either.
Others?
Uniform voxel grid not ideal for custom distance metric.

## Reflection
Personal reflection on project.

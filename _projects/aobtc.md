## Feature Highlights
Project was too big and too long ago to go into details on everything.
Briefly highlight some of my favourite features that I contributed to.

### Driving Model
Mostly visual tilt effect.

### Space Mode
Easter egg---mostly for fun.
Exploits tilt effect, but reversed.

### Split Screen
Not difficult in theory, but required rewriting and restructuring certain parts of code.
Basic version was easy to get working, but I remember many subtle bugs that needed to be fixed.
Satisfying pay off for mostly well designed code base (as far as undergrad projects go).

## Reflection
First major C++ project.
Looking back at code, not as bad as I would have thought.
Still one of most fun projects I worked on.
Game is surprisingly fun for what it is (I may or may not be biased).

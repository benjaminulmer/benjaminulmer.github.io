## Overview
This project is a collaboration with many people in [GIV](https://giv.cpsc.ucalgary.ca) group to produce a tool for visualizing and comparing COVID-19 data on a virtual globe.
Additional details and the webapp itself can be found [here](https://giv.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/project/covid19-visualization/).
Note that the data used for the app is no longer updated.
